A game prototype for a different spin on the traditional VR Archery formula.
{% include youtube.html id="B1SROinDm1A" %}
## Description

Players have the ability to control the arrow remotely after it's been shot by utilizing the hand that holds the bow. This mechanic challenges players to navigate their arrows through obstacles and reach targets in a dynamic manner.

### Arrow Control Mechanic
The arrow's trajectory is intricately tied to the rotation of the user's hand holding the bow. Unity's Lerp function is employed to create a delayed feedback system, ensuring the arrow's rotation mimics the hand's movements. As time progresses, the interpolation speed gradually decreases, limiting the user's control over the arrow and adding an element of urgency to hit the targets.


### Live Feed for Occluded Targets
Occluded targets are now conquerable with the introduction of a live feed displayed on a screen in front of the user. This POV feed enables players to skillfully guide their arrows around corners and behind walls, adding a strategic layer to the gameplay.


### Multiply Modifiers
The prototype showcases the concept of "modifiers" designed as buffs that users can apply to their arrows. The current version includes the "Multiply" modifier, which splits a single arrow into three, enabling players to strike three targets simultaneously. This strategic element enhances gameplay and encourages players to experiment with various modifiers to achieve optimal results.
